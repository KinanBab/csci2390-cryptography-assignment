# MPC Question

Your task is to implement a simple MPC voting application.

You are 2 of your friends are trying to have a secret ballot vote to determine where to go to dinner,
the options are: "DuneBrothers", "AleppoSweets", "GiftHorse", "BayberryGarden"
(yes, these are the best restaurants in Providence...)

Your implementation goes in `party.js`. The file contains more instructions.

## Running your solution

Make sure you have nodejs installed, we tested this using node `v14.18.1`.

First, install the required dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Then, you will need to open 4 terminals, one for the server, and one for each participant.

Run the server first using `node server.js`

When you see a message indicating the server is listening, you can run the parties.
```
# Run each command in a separate terminal window
node party.js BayberryGarden
node party.js BayberryGarden
node party.js AleppoSweets
```

When you run each party, it connects to the server, and then waits for all other parties
to be connected. When all are connected, the computation begins!
