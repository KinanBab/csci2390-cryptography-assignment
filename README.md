# Cryptography Assignment for Brown's CSCI 2390

This repository contains the code for the Cryptography crash course assignment in CSCI 2390 in Fall 2024.

See https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci2390/2024/assign/crypto.html for the assignment handout.

The *mpc*, *pir*, and *psi* directories contain implementation tasks to familiarize you with concepts used in the cryptography-based papers we discuss in the course. Each directory contains a README with further instructions, and in-line comments will guide you through the tasks.
